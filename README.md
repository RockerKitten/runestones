Runestones mod for Valheim

Requires BepInExPack for Valheim: https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/denikson/BepInExPack_Valheim/
With that installed, place the Runestones.dll release dll file into Valheim/BepInEx/plugins

To learn magic runes, seek out the random lore runestones in each biome. Each different piece of lore gives a different rune recipe. Monster-spawning runestones (such as the Boar, Greydwarf, and Surtling runestones) do not give rune recipes.

To use runes, craft a staff and equip it along with a stack of your desired rune. The runes act as ammo for your staff. Using runes will increase your magic skill, making your runes more effective. Typically something like effect duration would increase by a percentage equal to your magic skill, up to twice its original value at level 100 (skills are capped at 100, but there is no cap to amount of spell effectiveness that can be applied). The numeric values of a rune impacted by spell effectiveness and your magic skill are shown with their current values in gold text on the rune tooltip.
